# Peasy: An Intuitive Development Environment for P

[P](https://p-org.github.io/P/) is a state machine based programming language for formal modeling and analysis of distributed systems. Peasy is a step towards making application of formal methods in practice *easy-peasy* 😃. 

**Peasy** is a VS Code language extension for the P language. Peasy supports syntax highlighting, compilation and error reporting, unit testing, state machine visualization, and error tracing visualization. Navigate to the [Peasy webpage](https://p-org.github.io/peasy-ide-vscode/) for in-depth description and demo videos of all these features of the Peasy extension.
