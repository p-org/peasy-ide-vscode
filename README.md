- **Syntax highlighting** and a **Custom P theme**.
- **Snippets** to auto-complete P data structures and syntactical structures. 
- **Error Reporting** to detect errors after compilation.
- **Testing Framework** to test P files with `p check`
- **Iteration settings** for `p check` files. 
- **Error Tracing Visualization** to help debug errors in P project folders.

Below are [examples](#examples) of each feature.

### Iterations during  `p check`

When running automatic tests through P's Testing Framework, users can change the number of iterations run during the `p check` command by changing P extension configurations in .vscode/settings of your P project directory.

### Error Tracing Visualization 

Press `F6` in order to display a visualization that traces errors back to their source, enabling easier debugging.

## Known Issues
- Error Tracing Visualization is a Work in Progress.
- Pressing `F5` or saving consecutively too fast may cause an error message to appear in VSCode. Feel free to ignore this. 



## Install the Extension Locally
**NOTE**: Remove any previous versions of the extension from the extensions folder in .vscode. 
1. Clone this repository.
2. cd into the repository.
3. Run `vsce package -o ~ `. If the command errors, run `brew install vsce` and re-run the previous command.
4. The extension should now be in your user directory. Now, open a P code directory and navigate to the command pallete.
5. Search and click onto the command **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**
6. Install the VSIX file you just created.
You should get a notification saying `Completed installing P Extension extension from VSIX....`

**Reload VSCode, and your extension should now be working!**
**Enjoy!**
